# ZyNOS Notes

As no public information is available for many currently available ZyNOS versions, this will document what is known.

# What is ZyNOS?

As the [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZyNOS) states: "[it] is a contraction of ZyXEL and Network Operating System (NOS)".

# Which devices have ZyNOS-based firmware?

Quite a lot, actually, and not only ZyXEL branded ones. Apparently, ZyNOS code is available for licensed use in e.g. SDKs for ADSL chipsets, as can be see with say Trendchip.

# Have they any versioning?

They indeed do. I have observed the following ZyNOS versions as marked in ZyXEL firmware packages:

* 2.50
* 3.40 -- the most popular in ADSL routers
* 3.60
* 3.70
* 3.80
* 3.90

It is unknown to me which features are there.
